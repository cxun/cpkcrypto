<p> This package provides the abstraction of cryptography action and mapping of algorithms. </p> 
<p> 
{@link org.cpk.crypto.CPKUtil CPKUtil} exposes a group of functions that encrypt, decrypt, sign, verify data.<br>
{@link org.cpk.crypto.KeySerializer KeySerializer} provides some utilities to manipulate public/private keys.<br>
MapAlg* classes provides the mechanism to map an id to a group of indices, which could later be used by 
{@link org.cpk.crypto.pubmatrix.PubMatrix PubMatrix} and {@link org.cpk.crypto.secmatrix.SecMatrix SecMatrix}
to generate corresponding public key and private key.
