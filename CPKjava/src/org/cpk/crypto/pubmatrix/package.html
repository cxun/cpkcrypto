<p> public matrix is a group of data that used to derive a public key from an given id.
	client could use {@link org.cpk.crypto.pubmatrix.PubMatrix#GeneratePublicKey GeneratePublicKey}
	to get that.
	Also, {@link org.cpk.crypto.pubmatrix.PubMatrixSerializer PubMatrixSerializer} is an interface used to 
	serialize/de-serialize the public matrix. For now, only one class {@link org.cpk.crypto.pubmatrix.DERPubmatrixSerializer DERPubmatrixSerializer}
	implements this interface, which does the serialization in DER encoding.
